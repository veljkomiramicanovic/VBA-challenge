# VBA-challenge


# General overview:

Hi there, My homework submission is uploaded as per the instructions. There are three folders one for yeach year that have screen shots of first few rows & last few rows along with the challenge solution VBAStocks.vbs and that is the final script tht has the entire solution. I have approached this homework by reviewing the class lessons Credit Card Checker and WellsFargo. Started writing and testing my script on an even smaller data set of alphabetical_testing.xlsx, than I have added the worksheets reference and last row for loop, than I have tested on whole worksheet (alphabetical_testing.xlxs) and once successfully , tested the script on Multiple_year_stock_data.xlxs.

# Code Overview:

I've took an approach similar to the credit card checker activity for my code and I have added comments where necessary. The key part was handling the challenges as I did two approaches. First I have created a second for loop that would run through the table and generate the values for greatest stock volume, % increase and % decrease, then comparing these values to the percent change value generated for each value and setting the appropriate value as that percent change. 

# Conclusion:

I've spent couple days lets say 3-4 days trying to get this script right and functional, however would spend less time in other case if we don't working but it is what it is. Compared to new lessons which we have started now with Python, i've found that I'm feeling much comfortable working with python than VBA. Anyways this gave me a good grasp to implement my work on larger datasets.
